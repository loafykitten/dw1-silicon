//! PS1 BIOS (kernel) calls.
//!
//! The SDK's `rand`/`srand` in DW1's executable are three-instruction stubs that jump into the
//! BIOS (A(2Fh) and A(30h); `decomp/asm/us/main/psyq/libc.s`), so the game's random stream is
//! the BIOS generator, documented in psx-spx "Kernel (BIOS)":
//! `x = x * 0x41C64E6D + 0x3039`, result `(x >> 16) & 0x7FFF`.
//!
//! Ember's retail BIOS (`scph1001.bin`) keeps the state at RAM 0x9010 and implements exactly
//! that recurrence at 0xBFC021F0; DW1 never calls `srand`. Measured 2026-10-13 in PCSX-Redux
//! (S0.8, `oracle/probe-boot.lua`): the state is 0 after boot, and every change through the
//! first 206 calls is reachable by stepping it. Whether real hardware also starts at 0 depends
//! on the BIOS clearing that RAM at power-on (unverified).
